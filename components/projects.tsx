Tech Stack • Language: Golang • Frameworks: Bubbletea, Hugo • Tools: Git, Github Actions, Hugo for docs Detailed Project Description 1. Problem Statement: Beginners often struggle with git commands when getting started with git and version control, gitx was developed to solve this very problem and provide a platform inside the terminal to provide a beginner friendly interface, which provides an abstraction over git, takes away the complexity and allows user to learn and use git more easily. While gitx provides a great overview of git repositories, currently it lacks granular control for advanced workflows (like staging specific lines) and the documentation on tutorials and guides is also lacking. 2. Focus Area: • Backend Logic: Implementing new features to add more git operations to the Terminal User Interface. • UI/UX: Enhancing the visual diff viewer and adding interactive elements. • Technical Writing: Writing documentation for the \"Learn\" section on how to use the TUI. 3. Student Contribution Guide: The project will have 2 phases, completing the first is necessary to move onto the second phase, while the second phase would be optional and can be completed if the time allows. Phase 1: Implementation of New Core Features In this phase, the student would be expected to focus on coding and delivering the features listed on gitxtui.github.io/docs/contribute/roadmap; Also listed below: • Repository Initialization: Implement the ability to initialize a new Git repository (like git init) directly from the startup screen or command menu if one doesn't exist. • Safety Warnings: Add a confirmation and warning system for sensitive actions, such as initializing a repository in a non-empty directory or home folder. • Improved Visual Diff Viewer: Refactor the MainPanel view to provide a clearer, syntax-highlighted, or side-by-side representation of file changes. • Interactive Staging: Develop the functionality to select and stage specific lines or code hunks interactively from within the diff viewer. • Custom Keybindings: Update configuration file logic to allow users to remap keybindings (currently hardcoded in keys.go). Phase 2: Technical Writing and Education Resources This phase focuses on documenting and helping new users learn git through gitx. • \"Learn\" Section Content: specific hands-on document series explaining how to use the TUI for various Git workflows. • Feature Tutorials: Comprehensive guides and examples for the new features built in Phase 1 (e.g., \"How to interactively stage changes\").",

    desc: "Problem Statements:- 1.As the software components we develop at OpenPrinting are an essential part of the operating system infrastructure, we want to have a solid CI testing of each commit to our GitHub repositories. CUPS (\"cups\" repository for 2.x) has already excellent CI done by Michael Sweet, consisting of GitHub actions/workflows which automatically apply static analysers, build and execution tests on different architectures and distros, … This we want to have also in the other projects on OpenPrinting.    2.The go-avahi project provides Go bindings for the Avahi/mDNS/DNS-SD stack and is used for network service discovery functionality within the OpenPrinting ecosystem. It acts as a bridge between Go applications and the underlying Avahi daemon through D-Bus.\n\nCurrently, go-avahi has no fuzz testing, limited test coverage, and several input-handling paths may fail in unexpected ways for malformed or adversarial input. For this project,, fuzzing is especially important to uncover crashes, panics, and edge cases.\n\nThis project aims to develop a comprehensive fuzzing setup for go-avahi, improve test coverage, and integrate the project into the OSS-Fuzz ecosystem to enable continuous, long-term fuzz testing.   3.Currently, the go-mfp project, aimed to implement a full-featured behaviour-accurate MFP simulator together with collection of the MFP testing/validation/troubleshooting tools, lacks the support of WS-Scan protocol. We already have eSCL, partially implemented IPP, virtual USB MFP simulation (IPP over USB and legacy 7/1/1 USB printer), but WS-Scan support is not yet completed.\n4.Currently, the go-mfp simulator already has very basic support of the legacy USB 7/1/1 printer emulation. However, it doesn't somehow interpret the data sent to the emulated printer and doesn't provide any response (as 7/1/2 devices should do).\n\nThe project goal is to implement the Go io.Reader (for 7/1/1 devices) and Go io.ReadWriter that consumes raw data bytes, sent to the emulated printer and able to properly identify document format being sent (i.e., PostScript, PDF, PCL5, ESC/P, …) and based on that identification properly detect the document or page boundaries (for example, PostScript and PDF documents are terminated by the Ctrl-D character, ESC/P and PCL5 may use end-of-page character etc).\n\nHaving that implemented we can add saving documents to file for further analysis and troubleshooting and document rendering for printed image evaluation.\n\nAlso, the bidirectional (USB 7/1/2) printers implement a simple PJL interpreter and generate proper responses, which also needs to be implemented in the io.ReadWriter interface with functionality enough to make CUPS happy.\n5.The contributor should study how the legacy printer works, how the graphical documents are sent to the printer and how the printer recognizes that document transmission is finished. The printed documents need to be extracted from the unstructured host to printer data flow and passed separately to the upper layer, which will decide what to do with these documents (just to save to the log file, to render etc).\n\nRendering of printed documents is out of the scope of this project, so very detailed understanding of the relevant formats is not required.\n\nAlso, for the implementation of the bidirectional (USB 7/1/2) printers the contributor needs to understand the behaviour expectations, based on specifications and CUPS implementation and to write a simple simulator.\n\nThe representation of the emulated printer as a virtual USB device already done in the go-mfp and out of scope of this project. At this level the contributor needs only to implement the Go io.Reader and io.ReadWriter interfaces that can properly consume the data sent to the printer and to generate the proper response, the task of transporting this data from/to the host is out of scope of this project (and already solved at the first glance).\n\nAs result of this project, the code contribution into the go-mfp is expected, with the reasonable test coverage and integration with the \"big project\".",

The motive of creating this project is to provide a dynamic secret injection to containers/pods running inside Kubernetes from different secret managers for enhanced security.\nFocus Area -\nThe focus should be to stabilize the existing secret manager integrations, along with new feature support for secret manager.\nStudent Contribution Guide -\nSupport for more secret managers / backends: maybe add support for secret managers not yet supported, or improve existing ones.\n• Secrets versioning and rotation: introduce versioning of secrets, or periodic re-injection when secrets change in Vault.\n• Custom annotations or templating: allow more flexible templating for how secrets should be injected (e.g., naming conventions, path transformations).\n• RBAC / policy management UI or CRD: build a CRD or UI to manage which service accounts map to which Vault policies, instead of manual policy definitions.\n• Backup/reconciliation: maintain a reconciliation loop that ensures injected secrets remain up-to-date even after pod restarts, or if secret manager data changes.\n• Observability: expose metrics from the webhook (such as number of admission requests, failed injections, latency) via Prometheus.\n• Fault tolerance: handle cases when the secret manager is down, or when the webhook's certificate expires, more gracefully.\n\n3.Problem Statement -\nA golang based operator to create and manage EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana) stack on Kubernetes\nFocus Area -\n• Development of backend API features to support elasticsearch, fluentd, and kibana integration.\nStudent Contribution Guide -\n\nSupport for Alternative Log Collectors / Forwarders\n• Add support for Fluent Bit as a daemonset collector + Fluentd / ES / other outputs.\n(Although some upstream logging operators use Fluent Bit + Fluentd; if not present, this is big.)\n• Support for Loki as a storage backend (instead of or in addition to Elasticsearch) or other outputs (S3, Kafka, etc.).\n• Automatic Scaling & Lifecycle Management\n• Add CR-driven scaling for Elasticsearch nodes (master / data / ingestion) based on resource usage.\n• Implement lifecycle management of indices:\nrollover, retention, delete-old-index policies via CRD\n(or enhance existing index lifecycle CR).\n• Secure Multi-Tenancy / Namespacing\n• Build better namespace isolation of logging pipelines: allow CR per namespace, or per team, with RBAC.\n• Add validation / policy CRs to enforce which namespaces can write to which logging pipeline, or limit ES resources per tenant.\n• Observability Enhancements\n• Expose metrics from the operator: reconciliation time, number of CRs, failures, etc., via Prometheus.\n• Build Grafana dashboards for EFK stack health (ES metrics, Fluentd throughput, Kibana usage).",
