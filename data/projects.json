It provides a visual way to handle common git commands, making it easier for both beginners and experienced users to manage their repositories without leaving the terminal. Tech Stack • Language: Golang • Frameworks: Bubbletea, Hugo • Tools: Git, Github Actions, Hugo for docs Detailed Project Description 1. Problem Statement: Beginners often struggle with git commands when getting started with git and version control, gitx was developed to solve this very problem and provide a platform inside the terminal to provide a beginner friendly interface, which provides an abstraction over git, takes away the complexity and allows user to learn and use git more easily. While gitx provides a great overview of git repositories, currently it lacks granular control for advanced workflows (like staging specific lines) and the documentation on tutorials and guides is also lacking. 2. Focus Area: • Backend Logic: Implementing new features to add more git operations to the Terminal User Interface. • UI/UX: Enhancing the visual diff viewer and adding interactive elements. • Technical Writing: Writing documentation for the 'Learn' section on how to use the TUI. 3. Student Contribution Guide: The project will have 2 phases, completing the first is necessary to move onto the second phase, while the second phase would be optional and can be completed if the time allows. Phase 1: Implementation of New Core Features In this phase, the student would be expected to focus on coding and delivering the features listed on gitxtui.github.io/docs/contribute/roadmap; Also listed below: • Repository Initialization: Implement the ability to initialize a new Git repository (like git init) directly from the startup screen or command menu if one doesn't exist. • Safety Warnings: Add a confirmation and warning system for sensitive actions, such as initializing a repository in a non-empty directory or home folder. • Improved Visual Diff Viewer: Refactor the MainPanel view to provide a clearer, syntax-highlighted, or side-by-side representation of file changes. • Interactive Staging: Develop the functionality to select and stage specific lines or code hunks interactively from within the diff viewer. • Custom Keybindings: Update configuration file logic to allow users to remap keybindings (currently hardcoded in keys.go). Phase 2: Technical Writing and Education Resources This phase focuses on documenting and helping new users learn git through gitx. • 'Learn' Section Content: specific hands-on document series explaining how to use the TUI for various Git workflows. • Feature Tutorials: Comprehensive guides and examples for the new features built in Phase 1 (e.g., 'How to interactively stage changes').",

One motivation of this is to support the evaluation of the intracule (the distribution function for the interelectronic distance) and the extracule (the distribution function for the center-of-mass of electron pairs).\n\nWhat will you do?\n\nYour main focus will be to add functionality for the overlaps of arbitrarily many Gaussian basis functions. It is important to include screening, as otherwise the evaluations can be quite expensive. An important application, which should be supported with an appropriate API, is evaluation of the intracule and extracule. This is possible because, using tricks popularized by Beylkin and Monzon, almost any interparticle repulsion can be written as a sum of Gaussians. This would include the (many-body) interactions associated with nucleons and other types of codeensors and cohesors. This is a place where some creativity can be exercised, as innovative new algorithms and improved fits are being consistently proposed.\n\nFocus Areas\n• Implementation and testing of numerical algorithms.\n• Development of API (porcelain) to support the use of the new functionality.\n• Writing documentation and tutorial notebooks.\n\nExpected Outcomes\n1. Implement the overlap for an arbitrary number of (contracted, Cartesian or spherical) Gaussian basis functions.\n2. Add support for screening, with appropriate default parameters.\n3. Add functionality for evaluating the intracule and extracule.\n4. Utilities for computing positive integer powers of the electron density and relevant density matrices.\n5.

    "desc": "Project Statement/Description\n\nGBasis uses libcint as a back end for efficient integral evaluation. Unfortunately, the default installation of GBasis (with PyPI) doesn't include libcint, and installation from source is not easy for some users. The primary goal of this project is to fix this. The secondary, subsidiary, goal is to provide better support for the very rich set of integrals that libcint supports.\n\nWhat will you do?\n\nYour main focus will be to prepare a release of GBasis that includes libcint for PyPI. We want to support Windows, Linux, and Mac. Note that when we say libcint this includes libcint (generic C++ library) and its high-performance variant pyscf, for hardware platforms that support it. There might be multiple ways to do this, using, for example, Meson. We are agnostic as to the way it is done, but we note that (a) compiling libcint can be hairy and (b) we want an automated workflow so that updating GBasis is easy and new versions of libcint are easily supported.\n\nFocus Areas\n• DevOps automatic building, testing, and releasing of Python packages with compiled back ends.\n• Development of API (porcelain) to support the use of the additional integrals from libcint.\n• Writing documentation and tutorial notebooks.\n\nExpected Outcomes\n1. It becomes possible to pip install GBasis with the libcint integral engine.\n2. More (most?) of the integrals in libcint are accessible from GBasis. (This is basically wrapping more integrals. It isn't always trivial. #149)\n3. Write comprehensive tests and documentation for all new functionality.\n4. Write tutorial Jupyter notebooks that show how to use the new functionality.",

    "desc": "Problem Statement/Description\n\nAdd functionality to the GBasis library for evaluating 2-electron integrals, including non-Coulomb repulsions. The current Python implementation is very slow, but it also uses a very inefficient algorithm. A more efficient algorithm, combining the Obara-Saika and Head-Gordon-Pople recurrences, would fix this issue. One advantage of having this coded in (pure) Python is that it makes it easy to explore new screening methods, exploit sparsity, and include unconventional integrals (e.g., screened Coulomb interactions). Here is a good introduction to Gaussian integral evaluation, which can help you get your bearings without overwhelming you with (important!!) details.\n\nWhat will you do?\n\nYour main focus will be to (re)implement the 2-electron integrals in GBasis using the algorithm in the notes. This is important partly because it seems we may have a bug in the integrals for high angular momentum (cf. #216) and because the current implementation is painfully slow. It is very helpful for many people to have a pure Python implementation of the 2-electron integrals because, while it will always be (relatively) slow, it allows more flexibility for development of new algorithms and facilitates cross platform code interoperability. In addition, in many cases integral evaluation is not the performance bottleneck.\n\nThe key steps will be to: 1. Understand the recursive evaluation of Gaussian integrals. 2. Implement the key recurrences. (vertical, horizontal, electron-transfer) 3. Apply those recurrences in sequence to evaluate the 2-electron integrals. 4. Write functions for different 'initializations' of the Boys function to support different types of 2-electron integrals.\n\nFocus Areas\n• Implementation and testing of numerical algorithms.\n• Development of API (porcelain) to support the use of the new functionality.\n• Writing documentation and tutorial notebooks.\n\nExpected Outcomes\n1. Implement the recursive evaluation of 2-electron integrals into GBasis using the algorithm in the notes. This requires implementing several different recurrences, which are the 'building blocks' for the algorithm as a whole.\n2. Implement several different 'generalized Boys functions' so that multiple types of 2-electron integrals are supported.\n3. Write comprehensive tests and documentation for all new functionality.\n4. Write tutorial Jupyter notebooks that show how to use the new functionality.",
